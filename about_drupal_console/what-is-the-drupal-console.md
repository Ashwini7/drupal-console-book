# What is the Drupal Console?
The Drupal Console is a suite of tools run from a command line interface (CLI) to generate boilerplate code and interact with a Drupal 8 installation. From the ground up, it has been built to utilize the same modern PHP practices which were introduced in Drupal 8.

The Drupal Console makes use of the Symfony Console and other third party components which allows you to automatically generate most of the code needed for a Drupal 8 module. In addition, Drupal Console helps you interact with your Drupal installation. In case you are thinking *“Gee, isn’t that what [Drush](https://www.drupal.org/project/drush) does?”*, you should know that the Drupal Console and Drush development teams are cooperating and collaborating to most ideally bring their work together.

## Why we need the Drupal Console
Drupal 8 is more technically advanced compared to its predecessor and managing the increasing complexity of Drupal 8 could be a daunting task for anyone. Drupal Console is a suite of tools to help manage that complexity. Writing a Drupal 8 module now involves a lot more boilerplate code and there is a lot you need to know and do just to *get started* building a new module. These tasks can be repetitive and tedious, and can therefore create increased potential for errors. Fortunately, a lot of the new code can be automatically generated, using Drupal Console, without risk of copy/paste errors and with a lot of saved time.

## Benefits of the Drupal Console:
* Takes advantage of the Symfony Console and other third-party components to generate PHP, YML, and other files.
* Takes advantage of other modern development practices.
* Saves development time, both during migration of existing Drupal modules and when writing new ones.
* Provides easy-to-learn tools that make Drupal 8 development, by extension, also easier to learn.
* Reduces development time for remaining Drupal 8 tasks and for development of new modules.
