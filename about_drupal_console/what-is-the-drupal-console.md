# What is the Drupal Console?


The Drupal Console is a suite of tools that you run on a command line interface (CLI) to generate boilerplate code and interact with a Drupal 8 installation.

From the ground up Drupal Console is using the modern PHP practices introduced into Drupal 8. 

The goal of this project is provide a tool easy to use for everyone, from developers currently using Drupal 8 and those who are planning to learn.

Drupal 8 is more technically advanced compared to its predecessor. Writing a module involves a lot of boilerplate code. There are also a lot of things you need to know and do just to get started building a new module. These tasks can be repetitive and tedious and can therefore create opportunities for errors. Fortunately, a lot of the new code can be generated automatically using Drupal Console.

The Drupal Console makes use of the Symfony Console and other third party components which allows you to automatically generate most of the code needed for a Drupal 8 module. In addition, Drupal Console helps you interact with your Drupal installation. In case you are thinking *“Gee, isn’t that what [Drush](https://www.drupal.org/project/drush) does?”*, you should know that the Drupal Console and Drush development teams are cooperating and collaborating to most ideally bring their work together.

Managing the increasing complexity of Drupal 8 can be a daunting task for anyone, are you prepared for it? Drupal Console is a suite of tools to help manage that complexity. Follow along as we explore this tool.
