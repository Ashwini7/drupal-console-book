# Introduction

Some of you may have begun to explore Drupal 8 already, for those of you that have not had a chance yet I can tell you that there is a whole new new set of concepts.

Drupal 8 is more advanced compared to its predecessor, writing a module involves a lot of boilerplate code, there is also a lot you need to know and do just to get started with building a new module; these can be repetitive and tedious and therefore create opportunities for errors.

Fortunately, we have the Drupal Console, a tool which makes use of the Symfony Console which allows you to automatically generate most of the code needed for a Drupal 8 module. In addition, Drupal Console This tool  helps you interact with your Drupal installation. In case you are thinking *“Gee, isn’t that what [Drush](https://www.drupal.org/project/drush) does?”*, you should know that the Drupal Console and Drush development teams are cooperating and collaborating to most ideally bring their work together.

Drupal Console is another cool addition to the Proudly Found Elsewhere school of thought as it leverages the Symfony Console component to handle the CLI part.
