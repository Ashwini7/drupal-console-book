# Running the project
After using Composer to download dependencies, you can run the project by executing:

```
$ bin/console
```

## Create a symbolic link

You can run this command to easily access the Drupal Console from anywhere on your system:

```
$ sudo ln -s /path/to/DrupalConsole/bin/console /usr/local/bin/console.dev
```

**NOTE:** The name `console.dev` is just an alias you can name it anything you like.
