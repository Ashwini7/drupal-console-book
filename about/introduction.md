# Introduction

Some of you may have begun to explore Drupal 8 already, for those of you that have not had a chance yet I can tell you that there is a whole new new set of concepts. 

Drupal 8 is more advanced compared to its predecessor, writing a module involves a lot of boilerplate code, there is also a lot of things you need to know and do just to get started with building a new module and these can be repetitive and tedious therefore create opportunities for errors. 

Fortunately, a lot of that code can be generated automatically using a tool called the Drupal Console. 

Drupal Console is a project that takes the Symfony Console component and makes it available on Drupal to automatically generate most of the new Drupal 8 module requirements.

This tool does not only generates the module code, also helps you interact with your Drupal installation.

Drupal Console is another cool addition to the Proudly Found Elsewhere school of thought as it leverages the Symfony Console component to handle the CLI part.
