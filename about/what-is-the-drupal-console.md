# What is the Drupal Console?

The Drupal Console is an effort to bring The Symfony Console Component to Drupal 8.

The purpose of this project is to leverage the Symfony Console Component. The Console is a CLI tool that automates the creation of Drupal 8 modules and other recurring tasks.

As described on the Symfony documentation:
> The Console component allows you to create command-line commands. Your console commands can be used for any recurring task, such as cronjobs, imports, or other batch jobs.
