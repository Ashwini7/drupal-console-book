# Update project

The easiest and recommended way of updating Console is using the self-update command.

## Depending on the installation method:

### Installed globally (and renamed to "drupal"):
```
$ drupal self-update
```

### Installed locally (running from directory where the console.phar has been downloaded):
```
$ php console.phar self-update
```
